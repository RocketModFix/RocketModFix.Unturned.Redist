Interactability_Text_Line_0 General Boris' Diary
Interactability_Text_Line_1 ---
Interactability_Text_Line_2 Orders have come from the highest level to launch the warhead... at Moscow. They say that the city is being stormed by a dangerous virus, and that sacrificing it will save our country. I signed up to protect our motherland, not destroy it! I'm burning the message and cutting communications in the hopes that cooler heads will prevail and seek a cure rather than wiping out those pour souls. Should they try to attack and force a launch I'm afraid I'll have no option but to sabotage the missile.
