Interactability_Text_Line_0 Coalition Compound Raid Outline
Interactability_Text_Line_1 ---
Interactability_Text_Line_2 Enough is enough. We're going to launch a three pronged strike into the heart of the Coalition presence here kicking them out for good.
Interactability_Text_Line_3 ---
Interactability_Text_Line_4 Team A
Interactability_Text_Line_5 Due to dense walker presence in the city they leave their blast doors closed so we're not getting in there. The bridge entrances are a different story, however - they're left open the majority of the time. Your team will drive through both entrances simultaneously before they can react and provide covering fire from the overpass.
Interactability_Text_Line_6 ---
Interactability_Text_Line_7 Team B
Interactability_Text_Line_8 The sewer system is unguarded so your team can slip in and attack heavily armed with the element of surprise.
Interactability_Text_Line_9 ---
Interactability_Text_Line_10 Team C
Interactability_Text_Line_11 You'll be posing as survivors taking refuge through the main city entrances. You won't be able to smuggle in many weapons, but when the chaos starts you'll be able to begin the offensive from the inside.
