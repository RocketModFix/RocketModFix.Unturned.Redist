Interactability_Text_Line_2 I haven't talked to anyone from the military before, but this morning I was sleeping in only to have soldiers pull me out of bed and drag me down here to work the turntable. They wanted to take out good ol' Ivan. He's been parked here since World War II aside from the occasional display, but still runs just fine. I think I overheard one of them say something about blowing up train tunnels - either I'm hearing things or something's wrong.
