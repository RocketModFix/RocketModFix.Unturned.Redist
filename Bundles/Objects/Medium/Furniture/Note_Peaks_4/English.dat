Name Peaks Note - Lost

Interactability_Text_Line_0 It feels like I've been trapped down here for ages and I've been going in circles. I'm scared I'll never find a way out. It was just a normal hiking trip until I fell into that pit. They always told me I should bring a buddy! Now nobody knows I'm here. If you find this... please take care of my cats.
