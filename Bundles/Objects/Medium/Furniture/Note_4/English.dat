Interactability_Text_Line_3 Laura hasn't been to school for over a week now, and according to Mr. Green we shouldn't worry because her parents called to say they were moving to Madagascar... I don't think that's right because she would have told me, so I cycled down to their farm. Well at least where their farm used to be. Someone in a biohazard suit told me the road was off limits and turned me around, but I saw construction equipment and a giant hole where the crops used to be. I hope Laura's okay...
