Name Peaks Note - Logging

Interactability_Text_Line_0 It'd been a few weeks since my last contact with anyone in town so I took the trip in to restock supplies and see Jerry. I didn't go all the way in 'cause everyone was milling around in the streets. Looking through my binocs it was chaos, they looked extremely disheveled and I saw a few folks eating a corpse. There were multiple crashed cars abandoned on the way there and back. I don't know what to do or try next, but one thing's for sure: something horrible's happened.
