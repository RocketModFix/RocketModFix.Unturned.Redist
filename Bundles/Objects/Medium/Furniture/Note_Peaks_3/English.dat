Name Peaks Note - Train

Interactability_Text_Line_0 We couldn't slow down in time before hitting a rockslide on the tracks and derailing. This whole hill is unstable - I'm worried the tunnel is going to collapse. Everyone else was more severely injured in the crash so I've been chosen to go looking for help. I hope I find it quickly because I'm not equipped to be fighting any infected.
